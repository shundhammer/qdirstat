/**
 * Helper class for extended file size statistics.
 *
 * This collects file size data for trees or subtrees for later use for
 * calculating a median or quantiles or histograms.
 *
 * Notice that one data item (one qreal, i.e. one 64 bit double) is
 * stored for each file (or each matching file) in this object, so this is
 * expensive in terms of memory usage. Also, since data usually need to be
 * sorted for those calculations and sorting has at least logarithmic cost
 * O( n * log(n) ), this also has heavy performance impact.
