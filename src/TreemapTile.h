	 * TU Eindhoven, NL.
	 *
	 * This algorithm is not quite so simple and involves more expensive
	 * operations, e.g., sorting the children of each node by size first,
	 * try some variations of the layout and maybe backtrack to the
	 * previous attempt. But it results in tiles that are much more
	 * square-like, i.e. have more reasonable width-to-height ratios. It is
	 * very much less likely to get thin, elongated tiles that are hard to
	 * point at and even harder to compare visually against each other.
	 *
	 * This implementation includes some improvements to that basic
	 * algorithm. For example, children below a certain size are
	 * disregarded completely since they will not get an adequate visual
	 * representation anyway (it would be way too small). They are
	 * summarized in some kind of 'misc stuff' area in the parent treemap
	 * tile - in fact, part of the parent directory's tile can be "seen
	 * through".
	 *
	 * In short, a lot of small children that don't have any useful effect
	 * for the user in finding wasted disk space are omitted from handling
	 * and, most important, don't need to be sorted by size (which has a
