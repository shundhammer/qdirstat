	 * actions as long as they can be performed without problems. If there

	 * with the directory tree: The DirTree will show the subtree as
	 * deleted (i.e. it will not show it any more), but it still exists on

	/**
	 * Return the policy when an output window (see also OutputWindow) for

	 * commands, the output of those shell commands might be important,
	 * especially if they report an error. In addition to that, if a
	 * cleanup action takes a while, it might be a good idea to show the
	 * user what is going on. Notice that there will always be only one
	 * output window for all cleanup tasks that are to be started in one
	 * user action; if multiple items are selected, the corresponding
	 * command will be started for each of the selected items individually
	 * one after another, but the output window will remain open and
	 * collect the output of each one. Likewise, if a command is recursive,
	 * it is started for each directory level, and the output is also
	 * collected in the same output window.
	 *
	 * Possible values:
	 *
	 * ShowAlways: Always open an output window. This makes sense for
	 * cleanup actions that take a while, like compressing files, recoding
	 * videos, recompressing JPG images.
	 *
	 * ShowIfErrorOutput: Leave the output window hidden, but open it if
	 * there is any error output (i.e. output on its stderr channel). This
	 * is useful for most cleanup tasks that are typically quick, but that
	 * might also go wrong - for example, due to insufficient permissions
	 * in certain directories.
	 *
	 * ShowAfterTimeout: (This includes ShowIfErrorOutput) Leave the output
	 * window hidden for a certain timeout (3 seconds by default), but open
	 * it if it takes any longer than that. If there is error output, it is
	 * opened immediately. This is the default and recommended setting. The
	 * output can be configured with setOutputWindowTimeout().
	 *
	 * ShowNever: Never show the output window, no matter how long the
	 * cleanup task takes or if there is any amount of error output, or
	 * even if the cleanup process crashes or could not be started.
