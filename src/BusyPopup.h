/**
 * Simple popup dialog to show a message just prior to a lengthy operation.
 * The popup does some event handling to make sure that it really appears
 * before that lengthy operation starts: It processes events for some
 * milliseconds so its own show, resize, move and paint events are
 * processed.
 *
 * Usage:
 *
 *     BusyPopup msg( "Calculating...", mainWin );
 *     calc();
 *
 * In the normal case, just let the variable go out of scope, and the popup
 * is destroyed and thus closed. Of course you can also create it with
 * 'new' and destroy it with 'delete' or simply call 'hide()'.
