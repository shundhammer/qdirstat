 * This class provides some infrastructure as well as global data for a
 * directory tree. It acts as the glue that holds things together: The root
 * item from which to descend into the subtrees, the read queue and some
 * global policies (like whether or not to cross filesystems while reading
 * directories).
 *
 * Notice that this class uses a "pseudo root" to better conform with Qt's
 * notion of tree views and the corresponding data models: They use an
 * invisible root item to support multiple toplevel items.
