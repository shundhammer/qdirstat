/**
 * Class to keep QDirStat's "discover" actions self-contained.
 *
 * They access the DirTree that was created via the DirTreeModel in the
 * QDirStatApp. They all start with the SelectionModel's currently selected
 * directory or, if none is selected, with the tree's root.
 *
 * They all use a TreeWalker to filter out FileInfo tree nodes and present
 * them as a list in a non-modal LocateFilesWindow. When the user clicks on
 * one of those results, it becomes the current item in the SelectionModel
 * which means that the main window's DirTreeView will scroll to it and
 * open branches until it is visible, and at the same time it will become
 * the current item in the TreemapView.
 *
 * All actions in this class share the same LocateFilesWindow, so any
 * subsequent call will replace any previous content of that window.
