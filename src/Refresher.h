 * Helper class to refresh a number of subtrees:

 * OutputWindow::lastProcessFinished()), trigger refreshing all stored
 * subtrees.
 *
 * Do not hold on to pointers to instances of this class since each
 * instance will destroy itself at the end of refresh(). On the other hand,
 * if the signal triggering refresh() never arrives, this object will stay
 * forever, so give it a QObject parent (so it will be destroyed when its
 * parent is destroyed) to avoid a memory leak.
