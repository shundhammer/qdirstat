     * Manager class for a collection of bookmarks that each point to a
     * directory in the filesystem.
     *
     * A bookmark is just a string with the URL. It can be used to navigate
     * quickly to that location in the tree, or to select a number of
     * directories for a cleanup action such as clearing the contents of each
     * one of them.
     *
     * One example are the plethora of cache directories that all major
     * Internet browsers leave behind in the user's home directory in dozens of
     * locations, even if the user uses the "clear history" or "empty caches"
     * functions.
     *
     * This class is a collection of bookmarks plus a number of methods to
     * handle them; to read and write them from and to file, to add one, to
     * check which of them are inside the current DirTree.
     *
     * It also has a number of signals and slots to use them from menus and
     * widgets like the bookmarksButton next to the BreadcrumbNavigator where
     * the user can toggle the bookmark status (on/off) of the current URL,
     * and to indicate the status of the current URL as it changes in the
     * SelectionModel.
     *
     * The bookmarks are always kept in alphabetical order. Adding or removing
     * a bookmark
