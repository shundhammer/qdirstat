/**
 * Modeless dialog to display directories that could not be read when
 * reading a directory tree.
 *
 * This window shows an entry for each directory with a read error with:
 *
 *   - complete path
 *   - user name
 *   - group name
 *   - permissions in octal ("0750")
 *   - symbolic permissions "drwxrw----"
 *
 * Upon click, the directory is located in the main window, i.e.  in the
 * main window's tree view all parent directories are opened, the directory
 * is selected, and the tree view is scrolled so that this directory is
 * visible. The directory is also highlighted in the tree map, and the
 * details panel (unless disabled) shows all available details for that
 * directory.
 *
 * This window is meant to be connected to a panel message's "Details"
 * hyperlink.

 * even after such an operation since the strings (the paths) will still
 * match an object in the tree in most cases.

 * In the worst case, the search result won't find the corresponding
 * DirInfo * anymore (if that directory branch was deleted), but for sure
