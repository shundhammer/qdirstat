 * don't iterate over it; use DirInfo::attic() to access it.  Its sizes,
 * children counts etc. are not added to the parent dir's sums.
 *
 * The treemap will not display anything in the attic; that's the whole
 * point of it. Yet, the user can open the attic (the <Ignored> pseudo
 * entry) in the tree view.
