/**
 * Tree view widget for the QDirStat directory tree.
 *
 * This is a thin wrapper around TreeView that takes care about basic setup
 * and configuration of the tree view and adds support for synchronizing
 * current / selected items between the DirTree, the DirTreeMap and this
 * DirTreeView.
 *
 * The Qt model / view abstraction is kept up as good as possible, but this
 * widget is really meant to be used with a DirTreeModel and not
 * just any random subclass of QAbstractItemModel.
