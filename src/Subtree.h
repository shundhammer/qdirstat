/**
 * Class to store information about a subtree of a DirTree.
 *
 * This is basically a wrapper around a FileInfo pointer that takes the
 * very limited life time of such a pointer into account: Whenever a part
 * of the DirTree is refreshed (e.g. after cleanup actions), all pointers
 * in that subtree become invalid. While the DirTree does send signals when
 * that happens, in many cases it is overkill to connect to those signals
 * and monitor all the time for the off-chance that the one FileInfo
 * pointer we keep is affected.
 *
 * This class simply stores the URL of the subtree and locates the FileInfo
 * item in the tree when needed. In addition to that, it can also fall back
 * to the tree's root if that URL no longer exists in the tree.
 *
 * Not using Qt's signals and slots has the added benefit of not needing to
 * inherit QObject which means that instances of this class do not need to
 * be created on the heap with 'new', and they can be aggregated in other
 * classes.
