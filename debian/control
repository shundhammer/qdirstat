Description:  graphical disk usage display with cleanup facilities
 QDirStat (Qt Directory Statistics) is a small utility program that sums
 up disk usage for directory trees, very much like the Unix 'du' command.
 It displays the disk space used up by a directory tree, both numerically
 and graphically.  It is network transparent (i.e., you can use it to sum
 up FTP servers), and comes with predefined and user configurable cleanup
 actions.
